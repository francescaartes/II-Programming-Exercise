# II-Programming-Exercise
Create programs using Java, Python, and C++ language for each of the following problems.

1. Male and Female Percentages

Design a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of females registered in
a class. The program should display the percentage of males and females in the class.

Hint:
Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class. There are 20 students in the class. The
percentage of males can be calculated as 8/20 = 0.4, or 40%. The percentage of females can be
calculated as 12/20 = 0.6, or 60%.

2. Ingredient Adjuster

A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:
1.5 cups of sugar
1 cup of butter
2.75 cups of flour

The recipe produces 48 cookies with these amounts of the ingredients. Design a program that asks
the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, and then displays the number of cups of each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.
